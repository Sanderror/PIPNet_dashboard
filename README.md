This file contains the description and guide to our github. 

The first segment of our github is the model itself, forked from the PIPNET model provided to use for this course, these are the following files:
- dashboard_images
- features
- pipnet
- used_arguments

Then there are the following files that we used to create our eventual dashboard/explanation application. The app.py from bottom to app_test4.py 
have increasing increments, each application has new upgrades. 
- util
- app.py
- app_test.py
- app_test3.py
- app_test4.py
- main.py
- nauta_pipnet_cpvr.png

And finally the instructions on how to run the model, used for ourselves is stored in:

- the model_run_instructions.md
